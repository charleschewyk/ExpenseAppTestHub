Dear Edision, this is for your review. 

I am wondering how I can include the entire folder that includes all files to upload to Github. But it seems not possible. 
I wonder if I am doing it right, or this cannot be done at all at github. 

I tried to upload the entire folder but it shows an error screen. 

So In the end I am taking out the files fromm the project as a component and sending it here.
